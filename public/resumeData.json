    "bio":"My favorite work involves developing a product or tool which helps others. I often gravitate toward healthcare, education, and social issues for this reason. I have experience with Python (Pytorch, Tensorflow, Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn), JS (React, D3), Java, R, Matlab. I'm always keen to explore new concepts and learn. In my free time I'm a hiker, biker, rockclimber, and racket sports player.",
